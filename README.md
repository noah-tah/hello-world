# I was a young boy

I was a young boy when I created my first website, I didn't code my own HTML and CSS or anything crazy like that! In fact, I knew nothing about those languages or any kind of programming for that matter, I simply created my website using a free website building service called "SynthaSyte" or something like that (it was over 15 years ago!), and on that website I wrote content about dragons!!! Pretty cool, right? The funny part is that I copied all the content out of a book that I had bought from a garage sale a long time before, and I was obsessed with the book! It was basically an encyclopedia all about dragons! Complete with descriptions of different dragons, and it even had "scales" in it that you could feel the texture of! Incredible!
